                    Hi! My name is Medina, and I'm a passionate software development student based in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo. With a strong foundation in web technologies and programming, I'm currently deepening my skills through academic coursework and hands-on projects. I thrive on solving complex problems, optimizing code, and building responsive websites that blend functionality with clean design. Whether I'm debugging Python scripts or crafting semantic HTML structures, Iâ€™m always driven by curiosity and a desire to create meaningful digital experiences. My long-term goal is to become a data scientist or AI engineer, bridging the gap between software development and intelligent systems to make a real-world impact.
